              <h5>Mid Sussex Triathlon finisher, 2018</h5>
              <p>"A thoroughly well-organised event and friendly event, which seemed to attract first-timers and experienced
                triathletes in equal measure. This was my first ever triathlon and I found it extremely welcoming from the
                very first step of hearing about, finding online, and entering, through the small amount of simple communications
                before the event, to the day itself. The event director and his team put in a visibly enormous amount of
                effort to make a well-run day that was great fun to be a part of. Each section was well run, loads of helpful,
                friendly, and encouraging marshals on hand with a smile and a supportive word. Good signposting around transition
                and out on the course, and clear instructions. The competitors were a friendly bunch too, I could not have
                asked for a better or more welcoming and fun introduction to the world of triathlon and I will definitely
                be back for more."</p>

              <h5>Mid Sussex Triathlon finisher, 2018</h5>
              <p>"I wanted to personally thank you for my first triathlon experience. I entered as a dare in the winter hoping
                that my pals would join me, they didn't. Instead, i convinced two of their wives to enter with me It was
                a first for us all and we found everyone to be welcoming, friendly and full of useful advice. To be honest,
                we were all a little nervous when we arrived bright and early but speaking to other participants and marshals
                really put our nerves at ease So, i have no other events to compare this one with but credit where its due,
                we were well informed, treated well and felt welcome to be there. Everywhere was well marked out and there
                wasn't a question i could have asked that hadn't already been answered I had a compete lifestyle change to
                get me in shape for this event and have now got the buzz. i will be completing another triathlon asap and
                will 100% certainly return to mid Sussex triathlon next year, bringing with me as many friends as possible!!
                I cant thank you and your team enough for the most enjoyable morning i have had in many years
                <br/> Thankyou!"

              <h3>Ruth</h3>
              <h5>Mid Sussex Triathlon finisher, 2018</h5>
              <p>"I am writing to say a huge thank you for Sunday. A year ago I set myself the challenge of finishing the Mid
                Sussex Triathlon. It's been a great journey and I have now achieved something which at one time wouldn't
                have been possible. One of the reasons that my dream became a reality was the nature of this particular triathlon,
                its ethos and the fact that you showed an interest in my endeavour from the beginning. You have always been
                encouraging, offering to take me on a bike ride (although I was too lacking in confidence to take you up
                on the offer at the time) and full of words of wisdom along the way and quick to answer emails. The day itself
                was a triumph of organisation, I felt part of an exclusive club, everyone I met was encouraging, friendly
                and there was only support for the No 3 on my arm! The marshals were magnificent in every way - I could not
                have felt more encouraged. It is the perfect triathlon for a novice. Anyway, I will be back next year with
                a personal time to beat. I pity the person who takes over your role as they will have an almost impossible
                act to follow. with very best wishes to you and the rest of the team"</p>

              <h5>Manager, 4Sight Vision Support</h5>
              <p>"On behalf of 4Sight Vision Support and our 5 Visually Impaired triathlon competitors, thank you all so very
                much for all that you and Ben, Callum and Chris have done in recent weeks and on Sunday to make it possible
                for Julia, Belinda, Tim, Philip and Bernice to take part in this event. For Kip and me, it was fantastic
                to see what a thrill they all got from competing. I shall never forget Belinda's pure excitement after she
                had finished her cycle ride and, I think, incredulity that she had done so well. She was still buzzing when
                we left! Bernice too enjoyed it so much that she's wanting to train to do the whole thing (if possible) next
                year. Callum and Chris were absolute star pilots. Julia was amazed as her cycle time was considerably faster
                than last year. Maureen Many thanks for organising a great race again last Sunday - it was the 4th Mid Sussex
                Aquabike I have done now and I'll keep going in future years as long as my legs will let me. I won't ever
                win (how did the winner swim twice as fast as me?!!), but as my son said, I have been a consistent top-ten
                finisher! I'll be interested to hear about your open-water swimming club in due course and wish you success
                with that and with competing in future Aquabike events. Thanks again and all best wishes"</p>
